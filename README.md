# hangman

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman word guessing game in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` script.
2. The game will choose a random word, and you need to guess it by suggesting letters.
3. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the hangman is complete.
4. Complete the word before running out of attempts to win the game.

## Customizing the Word List

If you want to add or modify words in the game, edit the `words.txt` file. Each word should be on a separate line.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

```bash
python hangman.py
